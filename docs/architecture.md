# System Architecture

## Overview

The Ennovatex AI Platform follows a modular architecture that separates concerns between different modalities while providing unified fusion capabilities. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Model Architecture

### Text Processing Pipeline

**Model**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Type**: Sentence transformer based on MiniLM
- **Output Dimensions**: 384-dimensional dense vectors
- **Capabilities**: Semantic text understanding, sentence similarity, clustering
- **Use Cases**: Text classification, semantic search, content analysis

### Image Processing Pipeline

**Model**: openai/clip-vit-base-patch32
- **Type**: Vision Transformer (ViT) with CLIP training
- **Architecture**: ViT-B/32 with contrastive learning
- **Capabilities**: Zero-shot image classification, image-text similarity
- **Use Cases**: Image understanding, visual content analysis, cross-modal retrieval

### Audio Processing Pipeline

**Model**: openai/whisper-small
- **Type**: Transformer-based encoder-decoder for ASR
- **Parameters**: 244M parameters
- **Capabilities**: Automatic speech recognition, speech translation
- **Languages**: Multilingual support with focus on English
- **Use Cases**: Speech-to-text, audio content analysis, accessibility features

## Fusion Pipeline

### Embedding Extraction

1. **Text Embeddings**: Direct extraction from sentence transformer
2. **Image Embeddings**: Feature extraction from CLIP vision encoder
3. **Audio Embeddings**: Processed through Whisper encoder after ASR conversion

### Fusion Strategies

#### Early Fusion
- Concatenation of embeddings from different modalities
- Dimensionality reduction through learned projections
- Joint representation learning

#### Late Fusion
- Independent processing of each modality
- Score-level combination using weighted averaging
- Decision-level fusion for classification tasks

#### Attention-based Fusion
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Learned importance weights for different modalities
- Dynamic fusion based on input characteristics
